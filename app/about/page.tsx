                I am a software engineer working out of Lagos, Nigeria, and I am
                constantly looking for ground-breaking solutions to issues that
                arise in daily life. In my work, I spend most of my time coming
                up with innovative solutions to development problems. I've been
                a part of this industry for over two years and within those
                years, I've honed my analytic and collaboration skills which
                makes working with a team easier. I've also had the opportunity
                to serve as lead software engineer for different projects. Even
                though I stumbled upon code by accident, it's something I've
                come to really like. But like they say, good things come to us
                without plan, no? I especially enjoy watching code bring to life
                an entirely new beautiful thing, it's magical. For me, each
                project I have the privilege to work on is a new opportunity to
                learn new things, meet people with ideas that differ from mine
                and discover things about myself I never knew were beneath the
                layers of all of me. I enjoy watching anime and I am very into
                the Marvel franchise. I listen to lots of music and James Blake
                and Jon Bellion are probably my two favourite artists (for now).
                Let's not forget the guys at Snarky Puppy, they're amazing. I
                spend most of my free time with my family and my cat. I'm
                surprised you actually read all of that, well thanks for your
                patienceüòÖ I'm available for full-time roles and freelance
                projects worldwide. As long as you don't mind watching me work
                from screens away.
